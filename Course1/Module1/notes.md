# Module1: What is Data Engineering?

## Modern Data Ecosystem and role of Data Engineering

### Welcome to Data Engineering

- Data growing at unprecedented rate
- Businesses, industries, institutions, governments all over the world use data for making decisions that guide their future and the future of the people they serve
- The quantity of value to be derived from data depends on  just 2 things
1. The accuracy of the data
2. The efficiency with which we acess the data when we need it
- That is in short the job of a Data Engineer: Data Accuracy and Efficient Acessibility
- Huge demand of the Data Engineering job:
- Dice Tech Job Report of 2020 lists data engineering as the fastest-growing tech occupation with an annual growth of 50%

 ### Modern Data Ecosystem

It include a whole networks of **Interconnected**, **Independant** and **Continously evolving** entities:

- Data Sources
- Different types of analysis and skills to generate insights
- Active stakeholders to take profit of the generated insights
- Tools, applications and infrastructure to store, process and share data

Data sources can be

- Structured
- Unstructured

Ex: Texts, images, audio, video, user conversations, social media platforms, IoT devices, databases, etc

When working with data from different data sources, 
1. The first step is to make a copy of the data from their original sources into a data repository

- Focus on:
    - Acquiring the data you need
    - Working with data formats, sources and interfaces through which this data can be retrieved.
- Challenges:
    - Reliability of the data
    - Security of the data
    - Integrity of the data
2. Second step

- Focuses on:
    - Data Organization
    - Data Cleaning
    - Data Optimization for acess
    - Make the data conform to compliances and standards enforced in the organization

- Challenges:
  - Data Management
  - Repositories that provide
    - High availability
    - Flexibility
    - Accessibility
    - Security

3. Now users can pull the data from the entreprise repository.
- These users include
    - Business stakeholders: They may need reports and dashbords
    - Applications: May need custum APIs to retrieve these data 
    - Programmers
    - Data Analysts: They may need the raw data to work with
    - Data Scientits

- Challenges:
    - Interfaces
    - APIs
    - Applications

#### Emerging technologies

- Cloud Computing
Entreprises have acess to:
    - Limiteless storage
    - HPC
    - Open source technologies
    - ML technologies
    - The latest tools and libraries
- Machine Learning
- Big Data

### Key Players in the Data Ecosystem

- Data Engineers
- Data Analysts
- Data Scientits
- Business Analysts
- Business Intelligence Analysts

### What is Data Engineering
    
Data Engineering concerns with the mechanism for the flow and acess of data. It's goal is to make quality data available for research and decision-making

#### Tasks
- Collecting data
- Processing data
- Storing data for reliability and easy availability of data
- Make data available for users securely

### Viewpoints: Defining Data Engineering

Data Engineering envolves
- Designing
-  Building
- Maintaining Data Infrastructure Platforms, which inclde databases, Big Data repositories, Data Pipelines for between data between data systems

### Evolution of Data Engineering

Evolution in Data Engineering over past couples of decades
- Data quantity
- Data variety and formats
- Big Data
- Automation tools
- Cloud computing
- Various NoSQL databases and other data repositories, comparing to past years where only relational databases where available
- Evolution of IoT and API feeds
